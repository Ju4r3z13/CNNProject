In this project I built a Convolutional Neural Network and a Multi-Layer Perceptron.
- I trained them using two different datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
- I then ran the code using Google Colab to get access to the free GPU (for efficiency).
All the class constructions are commented, the rest of the code is just briefly explained. The purpose of this project was to observe the behavior of both machines under different hyperparameters and datasets and report the findings for a Machine Learning course.
